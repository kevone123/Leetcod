 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 Problem statement:
    A playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a reference to a previous song in the playlist. Otherwise, the playlist will end with the last song which points to null.
    Implement a function isRepeatingPlaylist that, efficiently with respect to time used, returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not.
 + Passes 4/4 tests
